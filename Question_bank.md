## ARP Table
 - Protocol used to map IP Address of a machine to its MAC address.
 - Why mapping is important ? :
   - he lengths of the IP and MAC addresses differ, and a translation is needed so that the systems can recognize one another.
   - The most used IP today is IP version 4 (IPv4). An IP address is 32 bits long. However, MAC addresses are 48 bits long.
   - ARP translates the 32-bit address to 48 and vice versa.
